OBJECTION is an Object-Oriented Programming initiative by IT students from Mapúa Malayan Digital College, focused on redesigning the MotorPH Payroll System into a scalable, modular architecture. Through abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance, the project transforms procedural logic into a maintainable, enterprise-ready software design.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🧩 Modular class-based payroll architecture
- 🔐 Role-based user hierarchy (Admin, HR, IT, Logistics, etc.)
- 📦 Separation of concerns
- 🔄 Inheritance-driven design
- 📊 Payroll computation engine
- 🧪 Academic architecture documentation (CRC Cards, UML, etc.)


Designed not just as a requirement — but as a developer growth milestone

## 🚀 Get Started: Usage Instructions

Get started with Payroll Hub in just a few steps:

1️⃣ **Clone this repository**

- git clone https://github.com/Jriv7929/Group-6_OOP_-A2101.git
  
2️⃣ **Open in NetBeans**

- Open NetBeans and select `File > Open Project`.
- Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the project.
- Ensure the `opencsv.jar` library is added to the project’s libraries (if not already included).

3️⃣ **Run Payroll Hub**

- Ensure `Employee.csv` is in the `data` directory with the required employee data.
- Right-click `MotorPH.java` in the `Projects` tab and select `Run File`.
- Follow the prompts to enter the employee ID, pay period, hours worked, overtime, tardiness, days late, and holiday work details.
- View the payroll statement in the console and check `MotorPHPayslip.csv` for saved data.
- **Note**: Ensure `MotorPHPayslip.csv` is not open in another application (e.g., Excel) while running the program, as this may cause a "file in use" error when saving the payroll data.

4️⃣ **Log in credentials**

**Employee**
- User ID: JLopez
- Password: 1234

**Admin**
- User ID: MGarcia
- Password: MMDC1234!
